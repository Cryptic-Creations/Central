## 📩 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously.  
If you discover a vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, use one of the following secure reporting channels:

### ✅ GitHub's Private Reporting (Recommended)
Use the "Report a vulnerability" button on this repository.  
This creates a private security advisory only visible to the maintainers.

🔗 [Report via GitHub](../../security/advisories/new)

### ✉️ Direct Contact
Alternatively, you can send a private report via email:

**📧 zangreot@gmail.com**

Please include:

- A clear, reproducible description of the issue
- The affected module or feature
- Optional: proof of concept (PoC) or suggested fix

---

## ⏱ Response Expectations

- You will receive a response **within 72 hours** of submission.
- Confirmed vulnerabilities will be acknowledged and patched in a private release.
- You will be notified once the issue is resolved, or if it is declined (with reason).

---

## 🧪 Security Tools

We plan to actively monitor and respond to automated security checks:

- [x] GitHub Code Scanning (static analysis)
- [x] GitHub Secret Scanning (token leaks, API keys)
- [x] Dependabot Alerts (dependency vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Runtime monitoring (future)

## 🔒 Note on Privacy

This project is closed-source and only runs on **one Discord server** managed by the developer.  
Despite the private nature, all security reports and alerts are treated with highest priority.
